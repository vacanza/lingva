4.1 - November 4, 2015
----------------------

- Correctly handle messages that have both a translation comment, and use Zope-style
  message ids.

- Catch and properly report errors during tokenisation of Python code.


4.0 - November 4, 2015
----------------------

- Rewrite the Python extractor again. Lingua will now parse Python code itself
  instead of using the Python ``ast`` module.

- Support message comments in Python code. These can be put in lines immediately
  before a line containing a message, and must be prefixed with a special marker.

- Use domain filtering for Python expressions where possible (i.e. when using
  translaction functions that take a domain parameter, such as ``dgettext``.

- Fix --no-location option to actually work.

- Add --no-linenumbers option.


3.12 - October 10, 2015

3.11 - August 6, 2015
---------------------

- Correctly handle Python expressions using braces in template text. This fixes
  `issue 62 <https://github.com/wichert/lingua/issues/62>`_.


3.10 - May 1, 2015
------------------

- Update ``i18n.sh`` example to show statistics when compiling catalogs. This
  reveals catalogs with fuzzy messages. This fixes `issue 59
  <https://github.com/wichert/lingua/issues/59>`_.

- Fix handling of line number parameter in the Python extractor. This fixes
  invalid line numbers generated for Python code embedded in other files,
  for example in Mako templates. This fixes `issue 58
  <https://github.com/wichert/lingua/issues/58>`_ based on a fix from
  Laurent Daverio.

- Warn when using a function call instead of a string as parameter in a
  gettext keyword in Python code. This fixes `issue 57
  <https://github.com/wichert/lingua/issues/57>`_.


3.9 - February 19, 2015
-----------------------

- Fix line number reporting for XML/zope/Chameleon extractors.
  `Pull request 53 <https://github.com/wichert/lingua/pull/53>`_
  from Florian Schulze.


3.8 - January 20, 2015
----------------------

- Add options to sort messages by either location or message id when creating a
  POT file. Based on `pull request 51 <https://github.com/wichert/lingua/pull/51>`_
  from Emanuele Gaifas.


3.7 - December 17, 2014
-----------------------

- Include used lingua version in POT metadata.

- Add support for message contexts in translationstring instances.

- Add support for i18n:comment attributes in ZPT templates.


3.6.1 - November 11, 2014
-------------------------

- Restore Python 2.6 compatibility.


3.6 - November 11, 2014
-----------------------

- Extend automatic context-comments for ZPT templates to also show the
  canonical text for sub-elements.  For example this markup::

     <p i18n:translate="">This is just
       <em i18n:name="wonderful" i18n:translate="">wonderful</em>!</p>

  The resulting PO entry for the outer element will look like this::

    #. Canonical text for ${wonderful} is: "wonderful"
    msgid "This is just ${wonderful}!"
    msgstr ""

  This is only do for sub-elements that have a name (i.e. the have an
  ``i18n:name`` attribute).


3.5.1 - November 11, 2014
-------------------------

- Fix a bug in the generated context-comment for substrings which
  caused part of the outer sentence text to be skipped.

3.5 - November 11, 2014
-----------------------

- When encountering nested translations in ZPT templates automatically add a
  comment to the sub-message with the full text for the outer sentence. For
  example this markup::

     <p i18n:translate="">This is just
       <em i18n:name="wonderful" i18n:translate="">wonderful</em>!</p>

  The resulting PO entry will look like this::

    #. Used in sentence: "This is just ${wonderful}!"
    msgid "wonderful"
    msgstr ""

  This extra context information can be very important for translators.


3.4 - November 3, 2014
----------------------

- Add support for the ``i18n:context`` attribute in ZPT templates. This is
  supported by Chameleon 2.17 and later to set the translation context.


3.3 - September 14, 2014
------------------------

- Modify the message format-checker to not consider a space ofter a percent-
  character as a format flag. Space is a valid flag but is almost never used,
  and this was creating a lot of false positives (for example a sentence like
  "take a sample of 5% of all candidates").

- Do not try to extract a message from ``N_()`` calls: these are explicitly
  intended to be used for situations where you pass in a variable instead of
  a string.


3.2 - August 26, 2014
---------------------

- Refactor the extractor API a little bit to make it easier for extractors
  to call each other. This is particularly useful when an extractor needs to
  call the Python extractor to handle local Python expressions.

- Correctly extract messages from empty elements that used HTML notation. This
  fixes `issue 48 <https://github.com/wichert/lingua/issues/48>`_.


3.1 - August 18, 2014
---------------------

- Make sure two message strings are added when a plural message is encountered.
  This fixes an error from `msginit` when it sees ``msgid_plural`` but only a
  single ``msgstr``


3.0 - August 15, 2014
---------------------

*Zope users*: this release changes the extraction for `.pt` files. You will
need to configure lingua to use the new ``zope`` extractor for ``.pt`` files.

- Make it possible to configure Babel plugins.

- Include a brief description in ``--list-extractors`` output.

- Rename the ``xml`` extractor to ``chameleon`` to better fit the syntax it
  handles.

- Add a new ``zope`` extractor. This is identical to the chameleon extractor,
  but changes the default expression engine used to TALES. This engine is now
  the default for ``.cpt`` and ``.zpt`` files.

- Allow per-extractor configuration.

- Fix handling of comments returned by Babel extractor plugins. This fixes
  `issue 44 <https://github.com/wichert/lingua/issues/44>`_.


2.5 - August 14, 2014
---------------------

- Correct handling of alternatives in TALES expressions when the pipe-symbol
  was surrounded by whitespace. This fixes
  `issue 43 <https://github.com/wichert/lingua/issues/43>`_.

- Extractors can now be hooked up from outside via entry points.

- Introduce ``lingua.extractors.Extractor`` object and use it as base for
  all extractors.

- Check for global ``.config/lingua`` config file in user's home directory if
  no explicit config file defined.

- Fix error message when detecting a syntax error in scanned Python code. Patch
  from tisdall (`pull request 42
  <https://github.com/wichert/lingua/pull/42>`_).

- Use a single wheel distrbution for Python 2 and Python 3.


2.4 - July 23, 2014
-------------------

- Correctly handle multiple alternatives in ZPT expressions. This fixes
  `issue 39 <https://github.com/wichert/lingua/issues/39>`_.

- Do not add ``c-format`` flag for messages without an percent-character.

- Fix timezone format at pot creation (remove colon).


2.3 - June 13, 2014
-------------------

- Fix incorrect invocation of legacy Babel extraction plugins. This fixes
  `issue 28 <https://github.com/wichert/lingua/issues/28>`_.

- TAL template handling fixes:

  - Correctly handle ``structure:`` prefixes in TAL expressions. Patch from
    Ingmar Steen
    (`pull request 32 <https://github.com/wichert/lingua/pull/32>`_).

  - Fix handling of multi-line ``tal:content``, ``tal:define`` and ``tal:replace``
    statements. Patch from Ingmar Steen
    (pull requests
    `35 <https://github.com/wichert/lingua/pull/35>`_ and
    `36 <https://github.com/wichert/lingua/pull/36>`_).

  - Fix handling of ``tal:repeat`` statements with multiple assignments. Patch
    from Ingmar Steen
    (`pull request 37 <https://github.com/wichert/lingua/pull/37>`_).


2.2 - June 10, 2014
-------------------

- Remove seconds from POT timestamps. No other tool includes seconds, and this
  appearently breaks Babel.

- Fix Python 2.6 compatibility. Patch from Hugo Branquinho
  (`pull request 25 <https://github.com/wichert/lingua/pull/25>`_).

- Fix installation problems on Python 3. Patch from William Wu
  (`pull request 27 <https://github.com/wichert/lingua/pull/27>`_).

- Handle TALES expression engine selection. This fixes
  `issue 30 <https://github.com/wichert/lingua/issues/30>`_.

- Handle Python expressions using curly braces in HTML templates. This fixes
  `issue 29 <https://github.com/wichert/lingua/issues/29>`_.


2.1 - April 8, 2014
-------------------

- Do not break when encountering HTML entities in Python expressions in XML
  templates.

- Show the correct linenumber in error messages for syntax errors in Python
  expressions occurring in XML templates.

- Fix bug in parsing of ``tal:repeat`` and ``tal:define`` attributes in the
  XML parser.

- Tweak ReST-usage in changelog so the package documentation renders correctly
  on PyPI.


2.0 - April 8, 2014
-------------------

- Lingua is now fully Python 3 compatible.

- Add a new ``pot-create`` command to extract translateable texts. This is
  (almost) a drop-in replacement for GNU gettext's ``xgettext`` command and
  replaces the use of Babel's extraction tools. For backwards compatibility
  this tool can use existing Babel extraction plugins.

- Define a new extraction plugin API which enables several improvements to
  be made:

  - You can now select which domain to extract from files. This is currently
    only supported by the XML and ZCML extractors.
  - Format strings checks are now handled by the extraction plugin instead of
    applied globally. This prevents false positives.
  - Message contexts are fully supported.

- Format string detection has been improved: both C and Python format strings
  are now handled correctly.

- The XML/HTML extractor has been rewritten to use HTML parser from Chameleon_.
  This allows lingua to handle HTML files that are not valid XML.

- Whitespace handling in XML extractor has been improved..

- The po-xls conversion tools have been moved to a new `po-xls
  <https://github.com/wichert/po-xls>`_ package.


1.6 - December 9, 2013
----------------------

- Add support for ngettext and pluralize() for correctly generating plurals in
  pot files.


1.5 - April 1, 2013
-------------------

- Do not silently ignore XML parsing errors. Instead print an error message
  and abort.


1.4 - February 11, 2013
-----------------------

- Po->XLS convertor accidentily included obsolete messages.


1.3 - January 28, 2012
----------------------

- XLS->Po conversion failed for the first language if no comment or
  reference columns were generated. Reported by Rocky Feng.

- Properly support Windows in the xls-po convertors: Windows does not
  support atomic file renames, so revert to shutils.rename on that
  platform. Reported by Rocky Feng.


1.2 - January 13, 2012
----------------------

- Extend XML extractor to check python expressions in templates. This
  fixes `issue 7 <https://github.com/wichert/lingua/pull/7>`_. Thanks to
  Nuno Teixeira for the patch.


1.1 - November 16, 2011
-----------------------

- Set 'i18n' attribute as default prefix where there was no prefix found.
  This fixes issues `5 <https://github.com/wichert/lingua/issues/5>`_ and
  `6 <https://github.com/wichert/lingua/issues/5>`_. Thanks to
  Mathieu Le Marec - Pasquet for the patch.


1.0 - September 8, 2011
-----------------------

- Update XML extractor to ignore elements which only contain a Chameleon
  expression (``${....}``). These can happen to give the template engine
  a hint that it should try to translate the result of an expression. This
  fixes `issue 2 <https://github.com/wichert/lingua/issues/2>`_.

* Update XML extractor to not abort when encountering undeclared
  namespaces. This fixes `issue 3
  <https://github.com/wichert/lingua/issues/3>`_.

* Fix Python extractor to handle strings split over multiple lines
  correctly.


1.0b4 - July 20, 2011
---------------------

* Fix po-to-xls when including multiple languages in a single xls file.


1.0b3 - July 18, 2011
---------------------

* Paper brown bag: remove debug leftover which broke po-to-xls.


1.0b2 - July 18, 2011
---------------------

* Update PO-XLS convertors to allow selection of comments to include in
  the xls files.

* Correct XML extractor to strip leading and trailing white. This fixes
  `issue 1 <https://github.com/wichert/lingua/issues/1>`_.

* Add a very minimal polint tool to perform sanity checks in PO files.

* Update trove data: Python 2.4 is not supported due to lack of absolute
  import ability.


1.0b1 - May 13, 2011
--------------------

* First release.
